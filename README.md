opengles
========

`opengles` is a supporting library around OpenGL, OpenGL ES and EGL.

Props:
  GPU memory garbage collection
  Ptr operation free
  Simplified rendering APIs
  Compile-time type check
  Run on Linux(Mesa), Windows and Android (OSX and iOS would be the next)
  Vertex Array Object Extension with fallback
  Draw Arrays Extension with fallback

Cons:
  Poor documentation and lack of tutorial
  No legacy APIs
  No uncommon extensions
  No support for most of glGet* functionality that harm performance

Documentation is still poor but I'm willing to write a tutorial someday.

Contribution is always welcome.
