ANGLE Project by Google
https://code.google.com/p/angleproject/

ANGLE is the translater between DirectX and OpenGL ES.

We attached a nightly build of ANGLE (both x86 and x86_64) so that users of this
library can avoid effort of installing Visual Studio Community 2013 and Windows 8.1 SDK.

ANGLE dlls which come with Firefox and Chrome is stable release which does not
support OpenGL ES 3.0 advanced features like instancing and transform feedbacks.


Building
========

The attached build is a bit old. It is a good idea to build the dlls yourself.

It takes really long time but worth trying if you get stucked.
